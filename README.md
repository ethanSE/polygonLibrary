# polygonLibrary
some functions for validating and altering polygons  
A library I am building out for validating user input for the bike bag project  
Users will enter a shape of a bag to generate plans for.  
The shape must be a closed polygonal chain and not self-intersecting.  
Goal: transform shapes by adding seam allowances.
